A production-ready CNN model that classifies potato leaf diseases with 100% accuracy. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, this system helps farmers detect Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy plants through leaf image analysis.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Real-time Data Augmentation** - Flip/Rotation transforms
- **Optimized CNN Architecture** - 6-layer convolutional network
- **Model Interpretability** - Prediction confidence visualization
- **Cross-Format Export** - .h5 & SavedModel support

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/potato-disease-classification.git
cd potato-disease-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
